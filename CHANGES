    0.01

Sage comes into existence

    1.0.0 - 1.0.4

We made a number of major fundamental changes, including redesign of
the database structure, general code reorganization, and a complete
redesign of the frontend GUI. The README was redesigned, and the
CONTRIB, CHANGES, and LICENSE files were added to the slew. Sage
0.01 was a complete mess, so 1.0.* is an attempt to approach the
problem (of stats extraction, processing, and display) in a totally
different way, circumventing many of the obstacles encountered by
0.01 in the process. We changed our numbering system to Linux kernel
version style, so 1.0.* was originally intended to be named 0.02.
Versions 1.0.0 to 1.0.4 specifically were partial releases of the Sage 
backend processing scripts.

    1.0.5

Sage 1.0.5 is the first release containing the complete sources for
the Sage 1.0.* backend. It does not contain the frontend.

    1.0.6

Sage 1.0.6 contains sources for the backend only, similar to 1.0.5.
A division by zero bug is fixed, and a few database table structures
are optimized.

    1.0.7

Another critical division by zero bug has been fixed, and the code for
processing points_per_wu has been moved out of the conditional blocks
and into the main part of the process_home function (since it is
processed the same way, regardless of the number of existing tables).
