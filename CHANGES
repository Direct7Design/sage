    0.01

Sage comes into existence

    0.02

We made a number of major fundamental changes, including redesign of
the database structure, general code reorganization, and a complete
redesign of the frontend GUI. The README was redesigned, and the
CONTRIB, CHANGES, and LICENSE files were added to the slew. Sage
0.01 was a complete mess, so 0.02 is an attempt to approach the
problem (of stats extraction, processing, and display) in a totally
different way, circumventing many of the obstacles encountered by
0.01 in the process.
