To install, first copy all of the included files to your
webserver. 

Then, create a new database (or use an existing one, if you
like living on the edge). This database must be in the 
mysql flavor. Alternative database API support is coming
later.

Next, edit "config.php". It will be in the "back"
directory.

$lockHole and $lockKey should be short, alphanumeric (to be
safe) strings. They must be used as a GET name/value pair
to refresh_root.php in order to run it (this is to prevent
abuse by spiders and humans). The defaults are okay, but
you should change them to better protect the database from
malicious earth-dwellers. Of the GET name/value pair,
$lockHole is the name, and $lockKey is the value.

$dbHost, $dbUser, $dbPass, and $dbName are strings
containing hostname, username, password, and database name
information. Note, Sage currently only supports MySQL.
This will change soon. This will change even sooner if
somebody contacts me (the samuraidev forums should be
adequate) in request of additional database support.

$teamNumber is an integer containing the team number of the
Folding@Home team whose stats you want to watch. In most
cases, this should be your own team. It has been set at a
default 37941 (my team) to help prevent syntax errors on
your part.

Now, save "config.php". 

Set up refresh_root.php to run regularly, every three
hours. On a Unix system, using Cron, you would add the
following line to the crontab:

0 */3 * * * /usr/bin/lynx -dump "http://team.com/sage/back/refresh_rooot.php?apples=oranges" >/dev/null

Of course, you may have to compensate depending on the time
zone of your server and the time zone of your users. Also,
this example assumes your webserver is at team.com, that
Sage is in the "sage" directory, and that you set $lockHole
to "apples" and $lockKey to "oranges".

If you do not run Unix and want to use Cron on your server,
please follow the syntax of the URL in the above example 
and use appropriate tools to complete the job.
